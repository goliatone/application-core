## About core.io

**core.io** provides a structure to quickly prototype Node.js applications by providing an eco-system of packages alongside a set of guidelines and conventions to ease development.

In a way **core.io** aims to be a workflow rather than a framework by providing a common application structure regardless if your project is web, desktop, terminal, or data focused.

**core.io** provides basic building blocks which are useful in any context and help with common tasks like configuration management, logging, dependency management and other basic needs of most applications.

## Getting Started

In order to develop **core.io** applications you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can follow instructions in the [Node.js][node] website to download and install these dependencies on your computer.

Make sure to go through the [getting started guide][#getting-started] to get a sense of what you can do with **core.io**.

## Modules

The heart of **core.io** is the [application context](#application-core), which loads and manages a set of core modules and which you can extend directly with custom logic or indirectly with custom modules or community modules.

Modules are intended to encapsulate code and make it portable. They also serve as glue to integrate libraries like Socket.IO or AMQP into your project.
